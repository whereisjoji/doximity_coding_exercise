Considering that the HTML Content Producer role is not a full-fledged programming role and that the instructions call for a "simple" responsive page, I was trying not to over code this.  However, I did want to consider SEO, Accessibility, Cross-browser Compatibility, and semantic markup best practices.  Additionally, I utilized helper classes throughout the document for quick re-usability.  Thank you for your consideration!
