ERRORS/SUGGESTIONS:

1.	Bold Tags <b> are being used to draw attention to certain lines of copy.  According to standards, they should only be used in cases where there is no other more appropriate tag to use.  I would suggest using <strong>, <em>, <mark>, or one of the heading tags <h1> through <h6>, depending on what the intent behind drawing attention to the copy is.  This suggestion can positively impact cross-browser compatability, organic SEO, ADA compliance, and overall UX.

2.	Line break tags <br> are being used to layout content throughout the document.  I would suggest using paragraph tags <p> to let browsers automatically apply margin property and/or targeting specific elements with css to add vertical space between elements/copy.

3.	Bullet Points are used in lists, but one appears to be used solely to draw attention to copy.  Additionally, inserting text symbols in HTML should be avoided as they are not fully cross-browser compatible and may render as junk text on the screen.  If absolutely necessary, I would explore using HTML Entities (ISO Latin-1 hexadecimal/decimal code) to create the bullet point. Though not a full-proof solution, the odds of compatability are a little higher than inserting a text symbol into HTML.  I would suggest using <strong>, <em>, <mark>, or one of the heading tags <h1> through <h6>, depending on what the intent behind drawing attention to the copy is.  The latter suggestion can positively impact cross-browser compatability, organic SEO, ADA compliance, and overall UX.

4.	The padding declaration in the div tag <div> should end in with a semicolon (;).

5.	The closing superscript tag <sup> is missing the slash (/). 

6.	Copyright text symbols in HTML should be avoided as they are not fully cross-browser compatible and may render as junk text on the screen.  I would suggest using HTML Entities (ISO Latin-1 hexadecimal/decimal code) to create the copyright symbol. Though not all HTML Entities are compatible, the copyright symbol is a very widely used entity so the odds of compatability are much higher than inserting a copyright text symbol into HTML.

7.	The target attribute of the anchor tag <a> should end with a closing quotation mark (").

8.	PDF documents often have ADA accessibility issues as they are typically viewed using a separate application or plug-in, and can thus cause confusion and navigation difficulties. I would suggest improving the copy to something like "click here to download Prescribing Information PDF" where "download the Prescribing Information PDF" is the clear and descriptive link text, in conjunction with aria attributes.  The most accessible friendly option would be to avoid the pdf file and link to html.  These suggestions can positively impact organic SEO, ADA compliance, and overall UX.
